Structure penguin, it holds three integers, the first two, x and y 
simply describe the position of the penguin on the board (indexing from 0). 
In the placement phase a flag equal to 1 means that the penguin can be placed.
Once placed the flag changes to 0 and remains so up until in the game phase 
the pegnuin is not able to move. Once this happens the flag gets turned back to 1
and the penguin is out of the game.
