Tests for the interactive mode of the game:

1. Upon launching the interactive version of the game we first tried to set the columns of the board to 0, -1 and 100 (not allowed):
Output:

    Please enter the X dimension of the board, use a integer
    0

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again

    Please enter the X dimension of the board, use a integer
    -1

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again

    Please enter the X dimension of the board, use a integer
    100

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again

    Please enter the X dimension of the board, use a integer

2. Second after setting the columns to a correct value of 10 we did the same test as above with rows:
Output:

    Please enter the Y dimension of the board, use an integer
    0

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again


    Please enter the Y dimension of the board, use an integer
    -1

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again


    Please enter the Y dimension of the board, use an integer
    100

    Wrong dimension silly! It should be an integer greater than 1 and smaller than 99. Please pick again


    Please enter the Y dimension of the board, use an integer

3. After setting the rows to the correct amount (10, but of course it could be anyting between 1-99) we tested
inputing the wrong amount of players (-1, 0, 9):
Output:

    Please enter the desired number of players, use a integer
    -1

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired number of players, use a integer
    0

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired number of players, use a integer
    10

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired number of players, use a integer

4. After setting the players to the correct amount we preceeded to do the same tests on penguins input:
Output:

    Please enter the desired amount of penguins that each player should have, use an integer
    -1

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired amount of penguins that each player should have, use an integer
    0

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired amount of penguins that each player should have, use an integer
    10

    The number you entered is not allowed silly! Please pick something in the range 1-4

    Please enter the desired amount of penguins that each player should have, use an integer

5. After setting the amount of penguins to the correct amount we placed the penguin of player 1 on tile 1,1 and
then tried to place the penguin of player 2 also on tile 1,1:
Output:

        1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10

    Where do you wish to place your penguin Player 2? Please enter integer coordinates:
    Please enter the X dimension of the board, use a integer
    1

    Please enter the Y dimension of the board, use an integer

5. The next test concerned movement phase, we generated a board 4x4 with 2 players each with 1 penguin,
and then tested what happens if a penguin wants to move into a penguin, what happens if a penguin wants to 
walk into an empty tile and move diagonally:
Output: 

Moving diagonally:
        1     2

6. Testing if the game ends properly:
Output:
        1     2
       ------------
    1 |     | 2P1 |
    2 | 1P1 |     |

    The game has finished!
    -----------Scoreboard-----------
    The score of the player with index [1] is: 6
    The score of the player with index [2] is: 2
